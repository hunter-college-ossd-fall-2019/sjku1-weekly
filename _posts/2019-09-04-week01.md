*Why I decided to take a course in open software development*

I decided to take a course in Open Software Development after having completed an internship at a startup that offers a web application built for certified nutritionists and their clients. I found it interesting that, as a developer, one could contribute to open source projects beyond reviewing the source code and offering suggestions. Subsequently, if one encountered an issue while using an open source technology, they had the option to address that issue directly and contribute their solution after having it reviewed by the original developers and others in the community.  

  What's more is that because there is a tendency for communities to form around open source projects, I became interested in learning about the other ways developers contribute to projects as well as how one may start their own project. In this way, I hope to be able to learn from developers with different experiences in the tech industry in a structured context.
