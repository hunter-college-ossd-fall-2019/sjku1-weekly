*Wrap-Up*

<!--

    This is the last blog post that you will write for this class. This is a chance to reflect on what you did. Go back to your first two blog posts. They asked you to write about

    why you decided to take a course in open source software.
    what types of contributions you thought would be suitable choices for you to make as your first contributions to an open source project, and
    what types of projects interest you and how you saw your relationship to them.

Did the course meet your expectations? What was different than you expected? How would you change what you wrote with respect to the last two questions (from Blog Post 2?)
-->

The easiest way to make your third post is to edit this one.
Go into /_posts/ and update the 2019-12-04-week13.md file.
