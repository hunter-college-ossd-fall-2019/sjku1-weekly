Project Exploration

<!-- For this week, your goal is to describe the project evaluation that you did. What was hard? what did you learn? Are you interested in the particular project that you evaluated now? What was the hardest task? Do not limit yourself to these questions. -->
The project evaluation activities for Gatsby and TensorFlow allowed me to develop a thorough grasp of the license, code base, documentation, activity level, and welcomeness of each project. It was a good opportunity to become more familiar with navigating a project's repository in order to understand a given project's structure as well as what kind of issues are addressed by contributors.



The easiest way to make your third post is to edit this one.
