Project Exploration

<!-- For this week, your goal is to describe the project evaluation that you did. What was hard? what did you learn? Are you interested in the particular project that you evaluated now? What was the hardest task? Do not limit yourself to these questions. -->
The project evaluation activities for Gatsby and TensorFlow allowed me to develop a thorough grasp of the license, code base, documentation, activity level, and welcomeness of each project. It was a good opportunity to become more familiar with navigating a project's repository in order to understand a given project's structure as well as what kind of issues are addressed by contributors. It was hard to read through some of the code base of TensorFlow, particularly concerning the implementation of some of the API's. Consequently, this taught me the value of reading through the overall documentation and then the relevant documentation before deciding on an issue to take on as doing so will provide an opportunity to familiarize oneself with the existing tools in the project. Comparatively, I found Gatsby to be an easier project to navigate and comprehend, though I found that I had to read the build files and documentation a few times over. I am still interested in Gatsby as a project to contribute to, and feel more confident in making my first contribution in the form editing the documentation after having reviewed accepted and closed pull requests on the project's repository. I think a significant contribution would probably be an issue labeled as `impact: med` after having worked through some easier issues successfully.
