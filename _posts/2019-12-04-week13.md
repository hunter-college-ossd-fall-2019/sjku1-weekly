	I think Tom Callaway identifies an important point about open-source software where the widespread implementation of an open core model by open source software companies does not work as a long term strategy. It may be that the open core model is most similar to a common practice in business of garnering customers' interest by offering a free trial or some sampling of their product in order to incite them to pay for the the actual product. The open core model is reflective of this in the sense that the open core is representative of a basic usage of the company's product which well in of itself, but users must pay for the cost of additional features that meet their individual needs. This approach has proven itself effective in many sectors, but technology sector is comprised of a technical user base and so there is less incentive to pay for unmodifiable features that only somewhat meet the needs of the user. What's more is that users are accustomed to making modifications to improve software and so making having a pay barrier for additional features seems counterintuitive. In this way, Tidelift introduces a unique approach to ensuring that open-source projects meet the needs of their users by providing a sort of "open-source financing" by companies that use the projects.
