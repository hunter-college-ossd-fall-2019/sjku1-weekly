While reading the [Contributing to Wikipedia][1] documentation and analyzing the [primer][2], it was interesting to see that the article structure was similar to an issue on a Github repository That is to say, an article is treated similarly to an umbrella issue where it is separated into subsections or sub-issues which, in turn, allows for the work to be distributed among individuals and results in articles that are comprised of contributions from multiple sources. What's somewhat troubling is the ease with which edits can be made to most articles whereby, unless marked otherwise, anyone can make an edit without having to request a review. Though an edit can be reverted, it seems like this type of workflow brings more harm than good in that the overall user experience is impacted by reverts that are usually avoided by the use of techniques like PR reviews. In addition, the sheer number of rules and policies in the contributing documentation is also disorienting, though this seems to be more so a consequence of the type of the contributions that are made than a lack of organization.
