_Some more advanced Git and theories about software engineering_



<!--
	reviewed sample git workflows that were done in class in order to develop a deeper understanding
-->


<!-- Cathedral and the Bazaar 


-->
The primary reading for this week was [The Cathedral and the Bazaar][1] by Eric Steven Raymond, which details an in-depth history of the theories about software engineering. In reading the text, several concpets stood out for me:

(1) [The Catheral and the Bazaar][1]
	
The conceptual framework of distinguishing open-source from close-source by likening a bazaar to a cathedral was interesting beyond the scope of software in that it speaks to a broader concept of a community of Makers. 

(2) [The Importance of Having Users][3]

As is noted in _Balancing Makers and Takers to scale and sustain open source_ article, end users are a fundamental component of a successful open source project because they provide insight into its use. From the perspective of an engineer, it is easy to get lost in the details of designing a feature, while from the user's perspective a feature needs to fulfill a certain purpose. 

(3) [When is a Rose not a Rose?][4]
	
Our in-class activities this past weeek included another git workflow exercise that provided useful practice with the commands `git fetch`, `git rebase`, `git merge` along with a visualization tool called gitg that displayed changes in the distribution of changes across branches. I found this workflow particularly helpful because it really helped to clarify the differences between `git rebase` and `git pull` through practice. Another interesting benefit from this exercise was the opportunity to read through the bash scripts included with the sample repository. 

Having read the [Balancing Makers and Takers to scale and sustain open source][2], it was interesting to read about the ways in which open source may be considered a common good in much the same way as fishing waters or fresh water where managaing the distribution of its usage is critical. 

I currently have the development environment for Gatsby set-up, have read through the documentation, though I have yet to settle on an issue to contribute to.
