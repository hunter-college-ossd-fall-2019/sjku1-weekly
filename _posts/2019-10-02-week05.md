*Collaborating on Projects*

I found [CodeTriage][3] to be a very intuitive tool to explore different open source projects. Using the checklist from the article [Finding a Project to Contribute To][1], it was easy to identify projects and evaluate potential documentation issues to work on. With this in mind, I read through the documentation and the contributing docs for [Gatsby.js][7]. I found that they offer online [Pair Programming][9] sessions for those interested in contributing to open source or to Gatsby which I believe would be helpful in potentially finding a mentor as well as getting a better idea of how people in the community teach each other.
	
Having worked through the blog editing [activity][6] as well as the team workflow [exercise][5], I found that, though I was familiar with the `git` commands we used, I learned a lot about making a neat pull request. That is to say, it's all well and good to contribute working code, but if the way it is documented is not clear, then it may cause more harm than good. The team workflow exercise made this particularly clear in that, though our team was consistently clear with our documentation, it was easy to see steps in the process where one could communicate something that was unclear. This could be when writing a commit message after making a change to a file, describing the technical details of an issue, or when requesting changes to a pull request. Consequently, I actively tried to implement "[micro-commits][8]" that briefly documented each incremental change that I made to a file, making sure that each message was clear and concise.
