*Collaborating on Projects*

Having worked through the blog editing [activity][5] as well as the team workflow [exercise][4], I found that, though I was familiar with the `git` commands we used, I learned a lot about making a neat pull request. That is to say, it's all well and good to contribute working code, but if the way it is documented is not clear, then it may cause more harm than good. The team workflow [exercise][4] made this particularly clear in that, though our team was consistently clear with our documentation, it was easy to see steps in the process where one could communicate something that was unclear. This could be when writing a commit message after making a change to a file, describing the technical details of an issue, or when requesting changes to a pull request. Consequently, I actively tried to implement "[micro-commits][7]" that briefly documented each incremental change that I made to a file, making sure that each message was clear and concise.	

Outside of class, I read through the documentation for [Gatsby.js][6] with the advice from [Finding a Project to Contribute To][1] in mind.
