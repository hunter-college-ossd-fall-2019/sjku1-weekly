This past week, Kevin Fleming visited to discuss Bloomberg LP's involvement in open source. It was interesting to learn that Bloomberg, in fact, heavily incorporates open source into its software to such an extent that it benefits from having its engineers take on issues maintained by a given project's issue tracker. In this way, the company makes significant contributions to the open source projects it uses which, in turn, reflect the features that the its clients require. As a result, open source projects like TensorFlow and Jupiter become better suited for commercial use having contributions made in the interest of customers beyond the scope of general users. What's more is that Bloomberg LP is able to make contributions using resources that individual contributors do not have readily available as was the case with Jupiter's user interface. Compared to Bill Reyner discussion of FactSet and its usage of open source, FactSet seems to be more so of a Taker than Bloomberg LP which seems to be akin to a Maker as described in Dries Buytaert's text.  

The reading that was the focus for this was ["System76 introduces laptops with open source BIOS coreboot"][6] which discusses the incorporation of the open source firmware [Coreboot][6] into two of System76's laptops. Users would then be able to make contributions to modify and improve the firmware on their machines opposed to having the utilized the closed source firmware that is used in the majority of laptops on the market. As a result, one would be able to optimize and adjust the BIOS(Basic Input Output System) on their machine as opposed to only being able to modify their operating system. In this way, users stand to learn and benefit from the firmware because the source code is readily accessible under the GNU public license.

In addition, I made several contributions to Wikipedia in the form of edits to the pages corresponding to the Shawangunk Ridge in New York and the sport of bouldering after having reviewed the contributors documentation for Wikipedia.

This week I selected a sub-issue of an umbrella topic regarding documenation for the project.

✅ Read through Contributions documentation ([week 7][1])

✅ Setup Development Environment + [fork][2] of Gatsby ([week 8][3])

✅ Filter through potential issues ([week 9][4])

✅ Select an issue ([week 10][5])

❓ Design a solution
