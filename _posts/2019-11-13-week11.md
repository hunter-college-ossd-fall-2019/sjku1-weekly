This past week, Kevin Fleming visited to discuss Bloomberg LP's involvement in open source. It was interesting to learn that Bloomberg, in fact, heavily incorporates open source into its software to such an extent that it benefits from having its engineers take on issues maintained by a given project's issue tracker. In this way, the company makes significant contributions to the open source projects it uses which, in turn, reflect the features that the its clients require. As a result, open source projects like TensorFlow and Jupiter become better suited for commercial use having contributions made in the interest of customers beyond the scope of general users. Compared to Bill Reyner discussion of FactSet and its usage of open source, FactSet seems to be more so of a Taker than Bloomberg LP which seems to be akin to a Maker as described in Dries Buytaert's text.

In addition, I made several contributions to Wikipedia in the form of edits to the pages corresponding to the Shawangunk Ridge in New York and the sport of climbing.

This week I selected a sub-issue of an umbrella topic regarding documenation for the project.

✅ Read through Contributions documentation ([week 7][3])

✅ Setup Development Environment + [fork][6] of Gatsby ([week 8][4])

✅ Filter through potential issues ([week 9][5])

✅ Select an issue ([week 10][10])

❓ Design a solution ([week 11][11])
