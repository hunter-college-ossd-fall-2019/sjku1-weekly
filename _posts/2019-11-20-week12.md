*Humanitarian Free Open Source Software*

In reading ["Election Fraud: Is there an open source solution?"][6], I think it is important to note that many presidential elections were decided by a small voter difference because of a few swing states. This exemplifies the fact that a system vulnerability in a few states can have a huge impact and that similar types of vulnerabilities in many states has the potential to have an even greater impact. In having election technology designed with an open source license, I would think that the software would be more robust and resistant to external tampering as the software would be engineered by the same community that uses it compared to having it outsourced to a private company. At present, the closed source licenses that were applied to currently implemented election software prevents developers from improving it despite the fact that the software is outdated.

For Wikipedia, I went back to the Shawangunk Ridge page and replaced a [broken link][10]. In addition, I [edited][11] the information of a prominent climber.

<!-- I navigated to the Community Portal, and then the subtopic ["Maintenance in General"][7] under the header "Content Organization" header. -->

After exploring the example sites included in the Gatsby repository, I found a broken link in the "Using Gatsby without GraphQL" documentation and submitted a low impact [pull request][8] on 11/19 using the [contributing docs][9] as a guide. Having communicated changes with a member and another contributor, I requested re-review of my pull request on 11/20.
