After having forked the Gatsby repository on github, I set up the development environment by updating my version of yarn and Node.js, as outlined in the [Contributions][1] docs, as well as by installing the development version of the gatsby command-line interface (CLI). There is very clear documentation on how to set up the development environment for each type of contribution (e.g. documentation, bug, feature) so this process was not time-consuming. Having done so, I looked through the issues listed under the Gatsby repository by filtering under `Hacktoberfest`, `effort:low` and `good first issue` individually. What I found was that though there are many issues that available, it is difficult to find one unclaimed. I think that this is both an advantage and disadvantage in the sense that a newcomer can see how a variety of problems are addressesed while also presenting a challenge in terms of being quick enough to claim an issue.
	
This past week Bill Reyner, from FactSet, was a guest speaker for one of our lectures where he provided an overview of FactSet as well as its relationship with open source. It was interesting to hear his perspective on open source as an important asset to the company as well as its employees where by contributing to open source projects, the visibility of the company in the industry is enhanceed and the engineers of the company feel greater work satisfaction. What's more is that his presentation brought greater clarity to the use of open source software in projects that are the intellectual property of a company.

This past week I made several more [contributions][2] to OpenStreet Map where I added in a restaurant, a park, and a Whole Foods to a local town. In addition, I began reading through Eric Raymond's [The Cathedral and the Bazaar][3] which I have found to be a very interesting read on the preeminent styles of software development.
